  If there is only one argument, it must be a dictionary mapping Unicode
  ordinals (integers) or characters to Unicode ordinals, strings or None.
  Character keys will be then converted to ordinals.
  If there are two arguments, they must be strings of equal length, and
  in the resulting dictionary, each character in x will be mapped to the
  character at the same position in y. If there is a third argument, it
  must be a string, whose characters will be mapped to None in the result.

  the part before it, the separator itself, and the part after it.  If the
  separator is not found, return two empty strings and S.

rsplit(sep, maxsplit=-1) -> [str]
  S.rsplit(sep=None, maxsplit=-1) -> list of strings
  
  Return a list of the words in S, using sep as the
  delimiter string, starting at the end of the string and
  working to the front.  If maxsplit is given, at most maxsplit
  splits are done. If sep is not specified, any whitespace string
  is a separator.

rstrip(chars) -> str
  S.rstrip([chars]) -> str
  
  Return a copy of the string S with trailing whitespace removed.

split(sep, maxsplit=-1) -> [str]

  characters, all remaining cased characters have lower case.

translate(table) -> str
  S.translate(table) -> str
  
  Return a copy of the string S in which each character has been mapped
  through the given translation table. The table must implement
  lookup/indexing via __getitem__, for instance a dictionary or list,
  mapping Unicode ordinals to Unicode ordinals, strings, or None. If
  this operation raises LookupError, the character is left untouched.
  Characters mapped to None are deleted.
