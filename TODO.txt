make decision about whether we have a context for each line - or just scopes
Work python function extractors...        
implement basic library in pseudocode...
Basic types implemented DONE
Need to implement relevant classes and builtin functions -- and file class also
implement dict and list comprehensions Partially Done
order completions alphabetically
sort out fromimports:
    two cases - we have a module and need to import just parts of it into our scope DONE
    we have a package and need to import a module DONE
    also deal with special case of '*'
Implement Sets DONE
Add methods to lists and dicts and sets oh my DONE
Make literal lists unique DONE

Add to expressions: lambdas, bytes, starred function args...


Refactoring... DONE
Refactoring part 2 - try and simplify all the structures...

structures:

lvl1: utils inferred_types scopes

lvl2: complex types: functions, classes, compound types

lvl3: builtins - this accepts a request for a type (as a string) and returns the relevant thingy

lvl3: parser - reads files, creates functions and classes and gives them their attributes
