# tested
An editor for python with support for TDD

This program is my first attempt at building a system using the "clean code" principles.

This should give you a text editor with syntax highlighting, but also allows easy switching between your main
source code and the relevant tests for this code.

Intended features
* syntax highlighting
* search and replace including regex s & r
* code completion
* code hinting
* code folding
* code navigation

* project navigation
* project settings (pylint code etc)

* run tests for current function, class, file, module, whole project
* highlight test results in test file

* run pylint etc on source code
* version control support (git, svn, mercurial)
